= ADR 0001: Architecture Decision Records
:status: Accepted
:date: 2025-01-15

== Context

We need a way to record significant architectural decisions for the UTF8DOK project.
These decisions should be:

* Discoverable in the codebase
* Linked to relevant code and documentation
* Maintained in a standard format
* Validated for consistency and completeness

== Decision

We will use the *Bridge Framework* (Lightweight Architecture Decision Records) with AsciiDoc format.

Each ADR will include:

. A unique identifier (ADR-XXXX)
. A descriptive title
. Status (:status: attribute)
. Context, Decision, and Consequences sections
. Links to other ADRs (:supersedes:, :relates-to:)

== Consequences

*Positive*:

* Standardized decision tracking
* Machine-readable format for compliance checking
* Integration with UTF8DOK's own compliance engine
* Clear evolution of architectural decisions

*Negative*:

* Additional documentation overhead
* Requires team discipline to maintain
* Need to keep ADRs updated as context changes

== Compliance Notes

This ADR follows the Bridge Framework format and will be validated by UTF8DOK's compliance engine.
